Lua RTOS is using same shell as Lua but few changes.

changes in org lua.c:
    1) rename

        int main(int argc, char **argv)

       to

       int lua_main(int argc, char **argv)


    2) comment out few lines
       - not sure why comment out instead of using macro

    3) replace lpushline to luartos_pushline
       - not sure why need this new function
       - maybe the tty behavior is little different than std tty?



make a shell component:

  shell.h/shell.c in components/sys/shell

  1) create a thread
  2) prepare stdin/stdout/stderr
  3) create new lua_State
  4) call doREPL on lua_state
